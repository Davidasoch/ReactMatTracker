## MatTracker

-still work in progress-

This web application is designed to track the material and enhace the traceability for audio, illumination and video companies dedicated to provide and run events.
It uses the Web NFC functionality supported by Chrome following the guidelines from [W3C WEB nfc](https://w3c.github.io/web-nfc/).


In this repository you'll find everything you need to setup the web application, alongside the code there is a database preset to try out the functions.

In order for the NFC functionalities to work you must be using one of the specified [supported Web browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_NFC_API#browser_compatibility) and turn on Experimental Web Platform features (for [chrome](chrome://flags/)).

The application recognizes the material by an ID that must be stored in the text field within the nfc data.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
